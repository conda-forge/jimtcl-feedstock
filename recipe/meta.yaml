  summary: 'A small footprint implementation of the Tcl programming language'
  description: |
    Jim is an opensource small-footprint implementation of the Tcl programming
    language. It implements a large subset of Tcl and adds new features like
    references with garbage collection, closures, built-in Object Oriented
    Programming system, Functional Programming commands, first-class arrays and
    UTF-8 support. All this with a binary size of about 100-200kB (depending
    upon selected options).
